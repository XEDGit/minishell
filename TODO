TO EVALUATE:
    add redirections to same fd (1>&2)
	make autocompletion choice like zsh

TODO:
    cd: add CDPATH support
	add perror() in error_int()

LAST CHANGELOG:
	add $() subshell expansion
    create variables with "VAR=value" as cmd

DONE:
    fix conditions with subshell
    add ~/.skurc
    Makefile compiling single obj files and then full project
    add specific fd redirections (1>file 2>file)
    add exec builtin (and with it support for vscode debugger)
    add source builtin
    add autocompletion within PATH
    fixed numbers after $, now recognised as empty variables
